Given a directed graph G =<V,E> consisting of N vertices represented as an adjacency list in the file dske.in in the following format:

    .The first line contains a natural number N, the number of vertices of the graph;
    .The next N lines each record the adjacency list of the corresponding vertex. Two vertices in the same adjacency list are separated 
     by one or several blank characters, a vertex without an edge connected to it (isolated vertex) is given the value 0.
